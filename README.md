Stuff and Projects for the subject "Artificial intelligence"

First Approach to machine learning, featuring one argument that has always interested me, Stars and space.
Here there will be some attempt to realize some correlation beetween the stars of the different dataset, using K-means or other clustering
algorithm, or using some classification algorithm such as Random Forest classifier, Support Vector Machines and K-Nearest neighbor.

All the dataset are focused on spectral class of the stars or other features, like Color index, Absolute and relative magnitude or either distance from the earth.

The "Balanced" dataset is currently being used to make the final trial project of my university course.
